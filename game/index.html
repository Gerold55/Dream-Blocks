<hr>
<p>Dream Blocks is a game made by LordStephen77 (and his collaborators!) and is inspired by Minetest, a very popular 3D game engine (open-source). It's a small, 2D, Java written and open-source game! While the code is only based on scratch, textures are inspired from many games such as starbound or terraria... The games support procedural generation and changes every week!</p>
